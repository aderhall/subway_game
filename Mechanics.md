**What is gameplay?**
Most importantly, a sense of exploration. MC is new to the city; just passing through, really, doesn't want to make a home here. The game probably opens closer to the outskirts and as the character explores different neighborhoods and city areas, things get more central?

Places to explore: city blocks above ground, metro stations, underground tunnels mostly. Most or all have unique aspects about them that make the world feel fun to explore. Some are extremely relevant to progression and get revisited multiple times (metro or tunnel hubs, character homes or frequented spots, etc), some areas show up only once or twice (maybe for special plot-related reasons), some aren't progression relevant but we still put effort into making them feel properly like their own areas. There's also a social exploration aspect: lots of NPCs to talk to on the metro, above ground, below ground... friends to make, enemies to make...

**Chapters**
I just finished Celeste and I really like how it's structured - there are 7-9 chapters of the game, each with its own feel, look and new mechanics that build on each other over time. I think that might also be a reasonable amount of game to have in a final product for Subway Game? MVP would focus on only the first one. 7-9 different "iterations" or "chapters" just feels like a good length to me, and a good number of neighborhoods/areas to eventually build out.

Also, areas can be fuzzily defined. Like stations on the borders of two areas can be relevant to both, there can be some amount of foreshadowing of areas and backtracking, etc. I'm thinking the map is somewhat linear but not perfectly, and it gets less linear farther into the game? (like a lot of Metroidvanias)

Do people like this? Or would you rather the story/map be less linear, more open-world concept? (Chapters could/maybe should be just an internal organization tool/don't have to be made explicit to the player)

**Chapter structure**
Initial part of each chapter is exploration of new area, talking with NPCs, getting a feel for the map and structure of the place, finding boundaries, coming across important objects/people, etc. This would be the majority of the time spent in each chapter and where most of the story progression happens. Each chapter could have its own mini-arc, or have story arcs span a couple chapters. Multiple arcs can happen at once as well.

At the end of most/all chapters, there's one or a few timed tasks to accomplish (varying by chapter? Standardizing the challenge per chapter would be easier but would require more structured support from the plot). This typically requires the player to navigate between two map areas as efficiently as possible, using the information gathered earlier in the chapter or previous chapters: e.g. train schedules, metro maps, shortcuts, favors from NPC friends, improving your movement over time (e.g. dodging crowds, navigating stations), etc.
- e.g. I'm imagining one challenge where you make a friend, then you and the friend have to communicate long-distance using some item, in order to open different areas of the map in sequence for each other?
- I'm also imagining that for some challenges, you may need to/get an advantage from preparing the route a little beforehand? Like e.g. you make friends with a conductor, and you get his promise at 8am that the noon train on his line will make an extra stop it usually doesn't make. Then you wait to start the challenge until just before noon. There could be a couple things like this that you need to set up beforehand.

If you fail the challenge, you (die?) (have to go back to the start of the challenge area and retry?) Ideally the challenge will not be deterministic so that you're not retrying the same puzzle every time - this will require some careful design.
