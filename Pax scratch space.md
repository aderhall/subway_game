everyone has their own problems and the MC's problem happens to be that they don't fit the systems
they exist by accident

Find a letter/journal - active plot
Something weird going on - passive plot
- conspiracy, emergency (quiet)
- Alex: this is very "cosmic"

communications gets knocked out? or boosted?
miracle chemical w unknown side effects (magicite)


Note on ch1 map draft: I'm naming things for internal organization, will have less player-comprehensible names in-game

Challenges: 
- (This would be a first chapter challenge) Part of a line is closed, have to navigate around the closure 
	- This teaches you something about the world: that the metro isn't reliable for everything
- You make a friend and have to open areas of the map for each other in sequence
- Straight up maze (probably deeper tunnels - unless we want to do an area of the metro which is legitimately mazelike and probably non-Euclidean)

Factions/systems to get a sense of:
- the railway for sure - even chapter in vibe space
- surface government (local?) - ch3 ish?
- chapter 1 is below surface faction?

What are things that can break?
- railway
- food or water or utility supplies for city?
- organized crime (esp underground)
- religion for sure

Items that could be found (almost like Mechanisms)~
- long-distance communicator (phone? I also like the idea of it being stationary though. telephone pole?)
- item to hold open one-way doors ("Ariadne's Thread")
- map room (collect colored glass shards to represent stations/lines?)
- key friendships
